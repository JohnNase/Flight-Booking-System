This is a Flight Booking System that offers a seamless and straightforward experience for booking airline tickets for your next travel destination. Our web application is built using technologies like HTML, CSS, Apache MySql, PHP and JavaScript programming languages, with a focus on providing a user-friendly interface for both clients and airline workers.

The flight booking system features a two-level user interface, including an Administrator and Client. The Administrator has complete access to all features and information on the website. 
The Client has a similar layout for the webpage, but with certain limitations and more personalized functionalities, so it can be more conducive to their needs. 
Clients can easily search and book a ticket based on their preferred destination, budget, deadlines, and ticket type entered.
There are different functionalities to be provided for the clients, that align to processes such as : the registration in the app, looking at already booked tickets, browsing on available flights, finding assistance on Help and Support page and so much more. 

We are focused on creating a user-friendly platform with a simple and uncomplicated process to let clients buy tickets with just a few clicks.
